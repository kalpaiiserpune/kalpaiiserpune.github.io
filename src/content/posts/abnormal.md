Trigger Warning: This article discusses multiple forms of trauma including sexual abuse and mental health. 


There was nothing too peculiar about the campus chatter in March 2020, except the usual brisk business that the end of semesters usually ushers in. Newspaper headlines about the new virus hadn’t infected the common psyche until the lines on the graph wriggled further up, and dead bodies piled up across the globe. Suddenly, we were living in the middle of a global pandemic, were being carted off to our homes, and a hazy scramble had ensued. The semester was suspended indefinitely - midway abandoned with heaps of unfinished coursework and untended assignments. What had started as a hiatus soon transformed into looming uncertainty as numbers didn’t bate, nationwide lockdowns were imposed and soon the world was gripped in panic. 


The semester, which had been disbanded earlier, had to be picked up as classes started again. But adapting to an entirely foreign system of learning that hadn’t been tested for its efficacy was a largely unsolvable problem. End-semester examinations were scrapped, and final grades for Spring 2020 were awarded by extrapolating scores received in the mid-semester exams. Some courses chose to give a Pass/Fail grade instead. Adil*, a then 2nd-year BS-MS student recounted, “In our 4th semester we were given P (Pass) grade for the Physics lab course. It undermines so much of work done in physics lab just to be disregarded in transcript.” 

The Fall 2020 semester was ushered in, online classes were put into place, but there were a number of considerations. Getting used to a system that was so out of the ordinary and different from our usual classroom setting wasn’t easy for students and teachers alike. 77.5% (268) of the 346 students who responded to our online survey felt that the quality of education had worsened in the online semester and 66.8% (231) of the people cited the lack of one-to-one interactions with both faculty and peers to be a contributing factor. 

Shekhar*, a fourth-year BS-MS student noted, “So most of my online class, I've been really silent. And I think it is the effect of the fact that you can't see your peers, and you can't properly respond to your peers, most of the time. You're just talking to a void, and that's very uncomfortable, that definitely worsens the learning outcome, because the classes are not designed for that kind of learning.” Sania*, a second-year BS-MS student also reflected a similar sentiment citing the sheer disconnect that online semesters brought. 

Some felt that even the amount of content covered in a few courses was more than usual. “The professors (in some courses) ended up doing a lot more material than usual. There were courses where the professors uploaded videos on holidays, tried to cram in as much material as possible in a video (which would have been somewhat hindered by live student questions during an in-person class)” said Alex*, a fourth-year BS-MS student, expressing an opinion seconded by others. However, there are people like Shekhar* who on the contrary felt that the content covered was far lesser than usual.

But it isn’t just coursework. For students in a science institution who have to work in labs and gain research experience, projects and lab stints are important, something that the pandemic has completely suspended. Shekhar* said “A lot of people in biology rely on the lab experience to be able to at least plan for the future, figure out what they want to do, and get recommendations from professors. And a lot of those things do depend on lab experience because not everything in biology can be theoretical.” 

67.3% (231) of the students from the survey also complained of not being adequately equipped for online classes, with reasons ranging from minor inconveniences to problems far more severe. Arun*, a second-year BS-MS student, elaborated, “I had to completely rely on my mobile data (on some days). So, one of the things I noticed is [that] G-meet takes up a huge chunk of data actually and so students who don’t have unlimited internet, they might actually face a lot of issues because of this.” Others struggled with fluctuating internet connections, some eventually switching to LAN connections. 

<img src = '/abnormal/pie chart 1-11.png'/>

Mayank*, a third-year BS-MS student, struggled since he did not have a laptop or computer. “Initially, it was not a big problem but there was a course in my last semester - Numerical Computation on MatLab. And exams on CodeTantra. If you give your exam on your phone, some or the other problem happens every time. I had to drop a course this sem because it is very difficult to do it without a laptop. Can’t do courses without a laptop because they require (computer) packages.” Udayan*, an iPhD student, noted that internet connections aren’t the only problem. “Electricity isn't a reliable source everywhere in the country. And so, even if you have internet like I have (decent enough internet that I can download videos), but the electricity thing is a bit of a problem. And so, therefore, I have to plan my whole study around the availability of electricity. So that's at least an issue or at least an issue that I never see discussed anywhere. Electricity is actually a resource.” 

Senior physics faculty, Dr. Sunil Mukhi when asked about his experience with the online semester added, “So, you know, from my side, it was pretty easy, because I'm quite well versed with devices and with the internet and with softwares, and I have a good internet connection. I think a few students suffered from poor connectivity, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas. But some others who had better connections were slow to adapt to online teaching and felt that the live sessions are not important - attendance in live sessions was only 35% of the class." 

<img src = '/abnormal/pie chart 2-12.png'/>

63.9% (221) of the survey takers also felt that their homes were not suited for or conducive environments to sustain the kind of academic rigamarole that is required. Reasons ranged from household chores and overbearing family members to being stuck in harsh home environments. Mabel*, a second-year BS-MS student, confided in us, “I do not have a friendly home environment. I legit[imately] had to stay in the same house with someone who had sexually abused me in childhood. My mental health deteriorated dramatically.” Mabel* was not the only one. 6.3% (22) of the people who took our survey reported having been stuck in abusive or toxic households. A slew of factors like precarious domestic situations, lack of social interaction, being away from friends, and a general sense of isolation may be among the factors that gave rise to a posse of mental health problems.

For Udayan*, being diagnosed with a mental health issue during the lockdown made it difficult for people working with him to navigate around it. “Initially, for the first two months, it just felt very surreal. They weren't insensitive to it, but it felt as if they didn't know how to deal with it, and would avoid mentioning it in future conversations.” 

Our survey revealed that students were lagging by an average of 4 weeks in their coursework. But in this whole chaos, is there a silver lining, if at all there could be one? Alex* explained, “Because of the recorded lectures, I could fast forward, skip ahead, go back. [Even after two months] I could still go back and revisit that lecture and understand.” He also noted that the lack of a strict attendance policy helped him focus his energy on courses that he liked more. As the weeks rolled by with no signs of the storm abating, many took into stride what we now have resignedly accepted as the ‘new normal’, despite the irreconcilable abnormalities. In Shekhar’s* experience, he noticed how professors switched to more interactive platforms and digital chalkboards while students started using collaborative platforms for group study. 

The administration did try to put in place a series of initiatives to help students. As Mayank* put it, “ I don’t feel like that (in response to, if the administration could’ve done any better). IISER is doing better than other universities. IISER is making an effort.” 
But when you are dealing with a student body that is so diverse in background and circumstance, to account for and accommodate everyone, might turn out to be a mammoth administrative job. Associate Dean of Graduate Studies(Exams), Professor Arijit Bhattacharyay, when asked about this said, “We realise that we have to do things online, but, many students don't have that facility to do and go through these online courses. And these students faced a lot of problems. Still, we had to go ahead without stalling things for an unknown period of time. We had to start this process with the ones who could actually join and do coursework online, keeping in mind that some are really getting just left behind, and we need to offer some help also to these students to cope slowly with this kind of change. That is where came all these different relaxations, given at times keeping in mind the difficulty of the students who are unable to cope due to lack of facilities.” 

Initiatives like making all library resources available online, making course selections more flexible, providing online counselor services for those who wanted to avail them, were put in place by the administration. But for many, these fell short of the needful. As Mabel* elucidated, “ There was no way to avail help while being stuck at home. Even to be able to contact counselors, I need a place where I can be private. And privacy is a joke at home.” 

The newly elected Student Council also had to rise to the occasion. Balagopal*, a student representative elaborated on the issues of how the Student Council functioned during the semester. “It was a first-time Council, so a lot of the structures had to be set up.” Alisha*, another student representative added, “Most people didn’t work, just 4 -5 active members. Most have problems at home. But it was very difficult. It was already a first-time Council, so there was a disconnect.” The Council found itself in demand to streamline the communication to bridge students’ grievances to the administration.

The Council surveyed the availability of the internet amongst students, only to find that 30% of the survey takers had subpar network connections. Administrative schemes like giving out broadband connections to students, mobile data packs, or even USB sticks containing course material were designed to help such students out. In the case of Mayank*, however, the lack of a computer made it difficult for him to even apply for administrative schemes like the USB sticks when he struggled with connectivity issues. 

Alisha*, when asked about the success of the USB sticks scheme, said, “Very few people applied for it, and some complained about the material on the USB being incomplete. We were not included after we gave them (the administration) information from the form about people needing the USBs.” She commented that the administration was keen on helping students out, but was limited by logistical issues. While they were successful in helping out most students who requested assistance with mobile data plans, the institute found it difficult to set up broadband connections remotely. This was confirmed by faculty members as well. Professor Arijit Bhattacharyay said that only 10-20 students had signed up for the USB sticks scheme, but about reimbursing underprivileged students for their internet packs, the institute ran into hurdles as the procedure to reimburse the students could only be executed once the students were back on campus - which has not yet happened in entirety. 

While everyone grappled with coming to terms with the newer methods of teaching, setting up an appropriate evaluation scheme opened a larger can of worms. The evaluation for the Fall 2020 semester, in the spirit of all things 2020, was unusual. The continuous evaluation that the fraternity at IISER had accustomed itself to over the years was done away with. It had been decided at the beginning of the semester that continuous evaluation would be conducted only if every student in the course consented to it and that it would carry very little weightage. It was capped at 30%, leaving the remaining 70-100% of the weightage to be determined by a single examination that would occur at the end of the semester after all students were brought back. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continued its scourge and most students were still sitting far away from the 98 acres of IISER Pune when the semester ended. After some deliberation about whether the end-semester exams should be conducted immediately after the end of the Fall semester or after the forthcoming Spring 2021 semester, it was announced that the end-semester examinations would be conducted from 11th - 27th January 2020. The announcement was made exactly three weeks prior, on 21st December 2019. It was also declared that the earlier bar on conducting assignments without every single student's consent was being lifted, as the admin was making plans to bring back students with poor internet circumstances. This resulted in a fresh set of assignments to complete for many students, who were already busy scrambling to study for their first-ever online exam. In some cases, assignments were announced with just two weeks to go until the end-semester exams. 

Students, the Student Council, and professors unanimously agreed that the dearth of continuous evaluations made the semester more difficult and stressful, in an already stressful year, however, there is no consensus as to why it was done away with. Professor Arijit Bhattacharyay said, “In hindsight, I understand that [it] was probably not a fully correct decision.” He also told us that the Student Council had approached the administration, to ensure that any evaluation that took place in the Fall 2020 semester should be one that was fair for all, on the grounds that a lot of students would neither have the privilege of good computers nor that of
good internet connectivity. “And we understood that, I mean, if this evaluation process is going to happen over a longer period of time, or rather many times, in bits and pieces , that [continuous evaluation] might be difficult for some of the students,” Professor Bhattacharyay said, explaining why the administration decided to do away with continuous evaluation. However, members of the Student Council gave us a contradictory account. According to Alisha*, the Student Council had collated a bunch of suggestions including continuous evaluation for the evaluation of the Fall 2020 semester at the beginning of the semester. However, she felt that it was unfair that the Student Council be blamed when the administration decided to make a U-turn from their earlier decision and allowed assignments to be conducted, a few days before the semester ended, since the Council’s suggestions had not been heeded to initially, and the clauses they had come up with had been largely ignored. 
Members of the Council also expressed their dismay at being excluded from the Academic Committee. “So, we are completely out of the loop with whatever decisions they (the committee) are making. Our academic rep[presentative] is just there, they are not part of any committee. The Academic Committee - we have zero involvement.” The Council members also suggested that greater interaction of the administration with the general student body might have helped. 

Students did write to the Academic Committee in the first week of December 2020, more than a month before the exams actually took place. A mail was drafted by some third-year BS-MS students and signatures were collected from other students who agreed that 100% online examinations would put too much at stake on a one-day performance and thus be susceptible to cheating and other malpractices, which could significantly harm the grades of honest students in a relative grading system. In their opinion, a fairer system would have been assignment-based evaluation where the concern of malpractice adversely affecting honest students would have been nullified. The mail was sent to the Student Council who forwarded it to the administration, but to no avail. The plans for a full-blown online end semester exam remained unaltered with many students having to determine 100% of their grade based on a two and half hour performance in an exam covering 100% of the syllabus for several courses. 

The platform for exams was chosen - CodeTantra. IDs were created for students by the administration and the vendor. When the first mock tests were conducted and students got access to the CodeTantra portal - they were concerned. There were three primary concerns - the website’s privacy laws, significant inconveniences caused by some proctors, and multiple avenues for unchecked malpractice. The students (mostly from third-year BS-MS) wrote to the administration immediately, in large numbers voicing their concerns. With regards to the privacy policy, students were concerned as the CodeTantra website said that the company could store and sell all data of the users. The administration was quick to react in clearing out that the privacy disclaimer hosted on the CodeTantra portal was not one that would govern the handling of students’ data according to the agreement between CodeTantra and IISER Pune, and sent an electronic copy of the privacy contract between the two organizations. With regards to the possibility of malpractice, students complained that no matter how rigorous the proctoring was, there would always be students cheating without being caught, as had happened in other big Indian institutes like IIT-Bombay [1]. They claimed to have pointed out specific ways in which students could cheat, to the administration. These included virtual machines, using other devices parallelly, having webcams on
the bottom of the screen as opposed to the top. Most of these emails had been written on the 4th of January 2020 - the day of the first mock test and exactly one week before the first exam. The administration responded promptly on the 6th of January, 2020, attaching a copy of an ‘Honour Code’ explaining the consequences that students would face if they were caught cheating. 

The exams happened. 


A large number of courses opted for MCQ-only question papers, likely due to the convenience of grading the tests, some students speculated. Some students welcomed all-MCQ papers. One said, “For some subjects having totally MCQs was a very good idea because, well, it made things easier of course. For example in maths, things such as proofs and stuff were lost but then it also reduced the burden on students.” Other students were not so welcoming, “They need to see how you understand the concept and not [just] take uses [of the formula]. You don’t just need to remember the formula, but you need to know the inner workings of it, how everything works. So I think for that, they shouldn’t [have had all-MCQ papers], MCQs would have been a bad choice.” The types of question papers were not the students’ only concerns. CodeTantra had glitches. “I got Bs in the course, where I had glitches in the exam, even though those courses were easy. I was muted, so I couldn't ask the professor any questions. And they were not attending the chatbox.” said a fourth-year BS-MS student. Their batchmates too had technical concerns, “All software work differently on different devices, there is no software key. And that should not be something that the administration believes. I hope they don't, because software are written by people. People make mistakes and bad things happen. So I was locked out of an examination (due to an unforeseen technical glitch). I got locked out for five minutes. That five-minute thing is not a big deal because the examination is worth two hours. But it is definitely a big deal because you're giving the exam at home and you can panic.” 

Students were also concerned about the proctoring at times, “First of all, the proctors weren't there half of the time. And I noticed, like connectivity issues and stuff, but then mostly, the proctors weren't there (and) that was really like a gateway for cheating.” said a third-year BS-MS student. Some students confessed to cheating, “There were some exams that were so information-heavy, I didn’t see any point in not [cheating]. I didn’t, you know, completely, like search on the website [for]answers to it. My cheating was like, I made some formula sheets, and I just saw formulas of them, or I just saw names, and I copied them in the exam.” Other students claimed to know about cheating. In a particular mathematics course, the professor found exact replicates of proofs from online resources, and those students were given an I (Incomplete) grade. A third-year BS-MS student speculated on whether only those students who had poor grades in previous semesters but good grades in the online semester, were accused of cheating. He wondered if students who had a history of good scores would’ve been suspected at all even if they had cheated. A few students were accused of cheating in a physics examination and were awarded an F grade. Ghazal*, a second-year BS-MS student, shared their experience of the ‘interrogation’ that followed, “[Without mentioning anyone's name] but I know a lot of people who have cheated in the exam, and almost all of them did not receive the mail. Yeah, a bunch of random people are chosen. Until and unless there is solid proof that I have copied from someone else, or I have passed on answers to someone else, I don't think that it is right for them to accuse me.” Professors too were concerned with
malpractices in the examinations and expressed their dismay at it, and measures were taken to disqualify all such papers. Professor Sunil Mukhi said, “The biggest problem which makes me very sad and heartbroken is that there was a massive amount of cheating. This has happened in my course before, and happened again on the CodeTantra platform. And I cannot blame the platform because frankly, if you want to cheat in an exam, you can cheat. I mean, it's not that difficult.” He stressed that there was only a limited amount that the CodeTantra portal could do to prevent cheating. “Well, the problem with the CodeTantra platform is it can only be limited to making you share your screen and have your hands and face visible. But there are a few issues which we couldn't predict. For example, some people's laptops have a camera at the bottom of the screen, this makes it hard to show your paper as you write.” 

A fourth-year BS-MS student also complained about not having had their evaluated papers shown to them in a large number of courses before the grades were announced. “So they (professors) were not given sufficient time to show us our papers? And that is really weird because, at IISER, you see your papers. It is very rare that a course instructor does not show the paper before submitting the grade. So this was almost non-transparent, it was like, ‘You have no right to look at your papers situation.’” 

The pandemic has affected almost everyone around the world. We talked to a few people from other universities to find out how they have adapted to the situation. A BS-MS student from IISER Mohali said, “We were given the freedom of paying the fees anytime during the semester and not before it started (which was compulsory earlier).” Universities around the globe have also shifted to varied patterns of evaluation. A student from the University of Illinois talked about the Covid Pass system which was introduced. “For people who might not perform well, the college takes this situation into account. We have an option for Covid Pass where you can apply for a course to become pass/fail. So, while others getting an A will keep their grade, you can waive it off so that your GPA doesn’t tank.” The Covid Pass system, if availed at the beginning of the semester required a grade of C- or better to earn the credit that does not contribute to the GPA but is assessed as credit hours [3]. A student from IIT-BHU (Metallurgy department) and an IISER Mohali BS-MS student talked about how their colleges implemented a grading system that focussed more on assignments and projects.

Professors have also been considerate and helpful in these testing times. Faculty from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, donated one day of their salary in June 2020 to equip students who did not have smartphones and data packs with the needful. The Vice-Chancellor of the government-funded university, Professor Suranjan Das made an appeal later in August 2020, “I feel it is our moral responsibility to provide the students who do not possess a smartphone (which they would have to return to the University upon the completion of their courses) and to offer financial assistance to those students who need it to upgrade their data connectivity. I am sure you will agree that the adoption of these measures is required to address the challenge of the ‘digital divide’.” [2] 

Professors at IISER Pune too were compassionate and active in providing relief during the pandemic. We spoke to Dr. Suhita Nadkarni who talked to us at length about the plight of some of the residents of IISER Pune. Apart from the students, staff, the campus of IISER Pune is home to labourers, who live with their families in the slums behind the tall shadows of the Rahul Bajaj Hall of Residence for Women. Most of these workers are migrants - and we know that the pan India lockdown was not kind to their fraternity. “I think we would see these people in the basti come and buy basic groceries from the store downstairs. And over the few weeks, it was shocking to see the changes in these kids who come basically running errands for the family, they were seriously emaciated.” Dr. Suhita Nadkarni told us. “Obviously, there was no work. And whatever savings they had at some point, they had run out of it. Also, because they were not local, it was harder for them to have access to the facilities that were provided by the government.” Dr. Nadkarni and her colleagues (Dr. Pooja Sancheti, Dr. Vineeta Bal, Dr. Aarti Rapol, and Dr. Aparna Deshpande) decided to take it upon themselves to help the migrant labourers in the slums. “I think the pandemic forced us to pay more attention to our local surroundings. 

One realized very quickly that the laborer’s camp (basti) in the campus was in dire need of help at that point. And this was something well within our reach. They were right next door, and it could be shocking if we as a community had ignored them. What was heart-warming and endearing was how quickly we were able to generate sufficient funds that we could give them basic ration until there was work.” She talked about the responsibility of the privileged to understand that their position is not based on merit alone but an advantage at birth, especially in India where caste and class differences still dominate our lives. It is therefore even more pertinent in times of crisis that we are willing to let some of this privilege percolate down. She also talked about how the migrant labour force in India is situated so low in the social hierarchy, and that many in the IISER community have taken up a long-term engagement with the Milk and Eggs program and the Doorstep school. “I think another useful lesson the pandemic taught us is this awareness that no one is above falling through the cracks. Before the pandemic, there was sense the world is running reasonably on smooth wheels. We just assumed that the kids in the bast' had appropriate nutrition, clothes, and toys and went to school as mandated by the government. Then COVID hit and there was a realization that someone taking care of the system had to be you and simply doing your job was just not good enough. Several people in IISER signed up for doing various things beyond the call of their duty. That the basti people are no longer invisible to us, doing their jobs in the background, is a big achievement of the times.” 

As the lines between reality and dystopia have grown incoherent, and we have been forced to stare uncertainty to the face, it has only been difficult to deal with our circumstances, and arguably more so to transition into newer systems, and harder still to design them. As the pandemic rages on with little hope of respite, in the end, we are all teetering to settle into a system that resembles the normal more and less at the same time, with each passing day, leaving barely anything that makes sense to the intuition. Will these circumstances last long enough for us to get acclimatized to them? Will they last even longer? We cannot say. We can only wash our hands, wear our masks, and brave this new abnormal.
