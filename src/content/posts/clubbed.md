Disclaimer : The primary focus of the investigation conducted and the article is the state of clubs at IISER Pune before the pandemic struck. The list of clubs we interviewed was not exhaustive. 


Club activities are an integral part of every college and they shape the social life of each student. A big portion of one’s imagination of college is the bustling social life that it has to offer, a major part of this is a direct result of club activities. IISER Pune has a number of clubs catering to various passions of its community. They create safe spaces for people to share their common interest and passion. They act as seeds for social groups to form and thrive. Clubs provide environments where freshers and seniors can socialise both inside and outside club activities. Students are drawn to clubs by a common interest, they then are able to form connections with others and eventually, friend circles form. In addition, our clubs are relatively informal as they lack rigid structures and binding rules and regulations. This allows for students to switch clubs easily, in tune with their changing interests. This also makes exploring a hobby more convenient as you can interact with most clubs without necessarily devoting long hours to them. 


But despite how ideal they sound, IISER clubs have their own set of problems, ranging from inclusivity issues to management troubles.


At the start of our investigation into work-life balance on campus, a form was sent out to the IISER Pune community. We received a total of 322 responses from students and faculty, both current and former. Here’s a summary of the same.

It has been seen that only a handful of people cycle through most clubs as active participants. Naturally, these people make most of the decisions, are appointed as coordinators, and benefit the most from the exposure and experience a club provides. Some club coordinators we spoke to felt that they shared similar backgrounds, are fluent in English, are from tier-1 cities, and have a shared cultural commonality that automatically creates an in-circle that could seem exclusionary to the outsiders. This divide, while not intentional, results in others, who often do not share the above commonality, getting sidelined. They mostly participate as volunteers, typically for a short span, before being disenchanted by the whole process and leaving the clubs completely. The whole club experience is then limited to people who already had access to such exposure. 


Cultural hierarchy is another concept related to inclusivity. Most people attending cultural activities, like those hosted by the Society for the Promotion of Indian Classical Music and Culture Amongst Youth (SPICMACAY), are people already proficient in, or appreciative of that art form. According to Gowri Niranjana,  former Navarasa (Dance club) coordinator, “It was a general thing among non-classical people that SPICMACAY uses way too much of Institute’s money to cater to a small population. And as it happens, this small population is what people call the quote, unquote, privileged group.” 


An anonymous volunteer of SPICMACAY felt that the majority of individuals attending their events were from parts of society that were more socioeconomically privileged. They added that people trying to get into classical arts felt undervalued due to their lack of knowledge of the same. Further, they felt that it would be greatly beneficial if sessions were held to introduce people to aspects of classical arts, analogous to the workshops held by the Pune and national chapters of SPICMACAY.


Several clubs have a similar connotation of ‘elitism’ attached to them, by students who feel that the formation of in-groups often excludes them from the leadership and administration of a club. Suryadeepto Nag, a former Drama club coordinator, said, “In every batch there’s the same 20-30 odd individuals, with the same shared English-speaking cultural capital, who participate in most club activities. There’s a very clear urban, English-speaker class bias that’s seeped in, intentionally or otherwise.”. Clubs like the Literary club face the same issues because a majority of the people constituting these clubs have had an advantaged background. An anonymous interviewee who has been a contributing member to Kalpa for numerous years said the following regarding Kalpa’s core team makeup. “So in the years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, one can see that most (if not all) of the Kalpa core team belonged to a single linguistic community. And it would be sad if students came and saw that all the members of the core team of Kalpa were Bengali, and felt like they would not be included. Because I don’t think that’s the case. I don’t think Kalpa was ever being exclusive on a linguistic basis, simply because Bengali students who applied to be a part of the Kalpa Media Centre were also not selected (without even having to give an interview or anything like that). My guess is that the large number of Bengalis might just be because some of the individuals were from the same friends circle and the selection was not necessarily on a linguistic basis.”


Saismit, ex-Lit club coordinator, pointed out how exclusivity emerges within clubs. 


From what I have seen, early on, one ends up making friends much more quickly in clubs. It does seem to be that people with better English and a more urban upbringing stick together and end up handling most of the clubs too, which makes it difficult for others to feel integrated.  


Gowri, however, agreed to the fact that this divide was not being intentionally created by the respective club coordinators, and happens despite them trying to be more inclusive.


Linguistic differences are an issue for a pan-India institute like IISER Pune. While it is commonplace to use English as the medium for interaction, and this certainly extends to most club activities, it should be noted that not all students come from similar English-speaking backgrounds. Though IISER tries to impart uniformity through its Academic Communication classes conducted in the first semester, some students are more conversationally proficient in English than others. This creates a divide that pervades IISER, even outside the classroom and into the social sphere. An anonymous interviewee narrated an account from one of their friends saying, “Their words were ‘Okay, I tried. I wanted to be there. But it’s just that everyone around me was speaking good English. And it just made me feel nervous. And I just thought that rather than telling everyone that I was not comfortable with English, so let’s just speak in Hindi.’ They just said, instead of doing that every time to talk to everyone, they would much rather be away from that, and not be embarrassed by that.”


IISER has an English-speaking majority running most of the clubs, with people from non-English demographics becoming bystanders, since they often do not feel included. This was one of the reasons for the emergence of language-based clubs which try promoting their respective languages and cultures on the campus through various activities. However, these clubs, like the Hindi and Marathi clubs, also cater to linguistic majorities, leaving the minorities still uncatered to. According to Suryadeepto, ““ […] apart from these three language demographics (Hindi, Bangla, Marathi) , if you don’t know English, it’s hard. Active members of clubs are going to have to keep telling everybody, regardless of whether you know English or Hindi, “please come and participate” [in club meets and events] and ensure that everybody feels welcome.”


The following is an account from an anonymous student on their past experience of feeling excluded from clubs: 


“I felt very inferior about my English because most of the people around me had this very fancy kind of English. And because of that, I used to feel like, “Oh God, like, I can’t even talk to these people”. And sometimes they even used to make me feel that… all these feelings were a bit kind of like not so direct, but you could sense it.


I attended most of the club orientations. But when I attended, I felt inferior to join a club, I don’t know. I felt different.”


Gender issues, not unlike linguistic divides, also often translate from classrooms to club activities. The gender gap in science is nothing new and a number of factors including unequal opportunities and societal expectations contribute to it. Clubs like Mimamsa have a noticeably poor representation of girls, with some years seeing zero participation by girls in certain subject discussion groups. Onkar Sadekar, a Physics Mimamsa member for three and a half years, told us that “ I remember that, in our year, there was not a single girl and probably ten of us were active in third year. So that was very drastic.” Aditya Khanna, the Maths Mimamsa coordinator in 2020, said, “ the first day, only one girl came out of, I don’t know, 18 people. So what we did for that was to ask the girls that were currently in Math Mimamsa and tell them to go out and tell other girls to come to Math Mimamsa.” He went on to explain that while this approach worked, the problem was massive and that “it never got (completely)resolved.”


Amogh Rakesh, the 2021 Physics Mimamsa coordinator, said, “the gender disparity does exist, especially in physics. I don’t know how to solve it or tackle it, especially in an online format.”  While most subject coordinators agreed that this was an issue they were actively trying to solve, they also accepted that their efforts haven’t been very fruitful. 


This is a trend that is observed even in other academically-driven clubs. Maths club, for instance, had zero female volunteers for their events, which resulted in a club run mostly by male volunteers. 


On asking the few girls who attended the question-making sessions of Mimamsa, we were informed that there weren’t any outward biases towards girls. Most coordinators were of the opinion that the societal bias seen in academia is mirrored in Mimamsa and as such, solving this issue was out of their hands. However, Nandini Hazra, Mimamsa’s first female General Coordinator (Mimamsa has had only three, as of the time of writing this article), countered this by saying, “I absolutely hate it when people say that. We are not talking about how society is but how it should be.” She further detailed Mimamsa’s issues by saying that it fosters a culture wherein “ruthless” people are preferred in management positions as they get work done in short timeframes. However, getting more work done doesn’t necessarily mean that the work is being done in an inclusive manner. Another shortcoming, as she saw it, was Mimamsa’s failure to create safe spaces. In its weekly sessions, people often tackle new scientific concepts and frame questions. She felt that there should be enough space in this process that allows the volunteers to feel comfortable being “stupid”, by asking doubts that may seem redundant or silly. According to her, Mimamsa volunteers often faced swift rebuttal or judgement on saying “stupid” things and while men bounced back from these slap downs, many women were not in a position to do the same due to a lack of social cushioning, fueled by their higher baseline requirement to stand out in a patriarchal society. This, she felt, resulted in a lot of women joining at the beginning of the term and then haemorrhaging out very rapidly.


The dwindling number of female Question-Making Coordinators (QMCs) is attributed to the lower female participation in the question-making sessions. However, this doesn’t explain the inexcusable lack of women in the organisational structure of Mimamsa. Without women in positions of power, it becomes difficult to include diverse voices in decision-making and creates a less inclusive environment overall. It also passively fosters an unempathetic culture of work towards women. Lastly, it further raises the barrier against the entry of women into the organisational structure of the club. 


Organisational structure becomes a matter of concern for clubs for other reasons as well. Club Coordinators often have to deal with multiple management issues as most clubs don’t have a well-functioning core team. This puts most of the burden on the shoulders of club coordinators, which is usually three students, who have to manage academics along with club responsibilities. An efficient core team can help divide the work with ample space for creativity and let the members focus on social issues that plague these clubs. Disha, for instance, is structured to have coordinators from across batches and GCs who are usually fourth year students. Navarasa is another example to show how active core teams can revive dying clubs. Gowri Niranjana detailed the process they undertook at Navarasa to rejuvenate the club. First, a strict set of guidelines were drawn up. Only those volunteers who were able to adhere to these criteria were inducted into the core team. A number of trust-building exercises followed which ensured that the members of the core team were all highly motivated and collectively invested in the club. She said that led to the smooth functioning of the club, with members able to focus more on being creative and ideating, rather than dealing with the daily hurdles of running a club.


Many clubs have followed suit to constitute a core team for efficiently running a club. However, it is to be noted that core teams traditionally have shown to be especially successful for larger clubs with a larger volunteer base like Navarasa, Mimamsa, Disha, Kalpa, and Drama club to name a few.


Most of the club volunteers are first and second year students. However, there has been an observed decline in the participation of the incoming batches in recent years. Some coordinators pin this dip in participation on the increasing competitiveness of new batches. They theorised that the newer batches are more academically oriented, owing partly to the larger stature of IISER in India. Curriculum change is also an important factor according to many club coordinators as it puts extra pressure on new students joining the college. They were of the opinion that the new curriculum introduced from the 2019 batch allowed for less free time during the first four semesters. Some other coordinators, however, see this dip as nothing more than random variability and that different batches, regardless of the competitiveness or curriculum, have been active at different rates. Decreasing participation as students advance through IISER is another problem that coordinators have to deal with. The volunteer base of most clubs tends to reduce over the course of the academic journey as students from third, fourth and fifth years choose to spend time in fewer clubs. To solve this, some coordinators suggested including club timings in the official schedule, and giving credits for the amount of clubs a person attends. However, when we put these points to other coordinators, they said that the increased academic load would make participation in multiple clubs difficult and so the dip was only natural. They also pointed out the logistical limitations involved and the fact that IISER clubs are very unofficial and involving the administration would enforce rigidity. As Gowri Niranjana put it, “If you really want to participate, you always find a way.” 


PhD and BSMS students seem to live in different spaces, with there being very little association between the two groups. Some coordinators felt that the club activities were scheduled towards the BSMS body simply because BSMS students made the schedules. Despite club activities (or any other recreational activity) usually being the only places for interaction, the two groups tended to remain dissociated even at club events. Multiple coordinators cited the significant age gap and differing class schedules as reasons for this disconnect. Some also said that most PhD students are at a different phase in their life and have lived through the club experience already, making them more focused in their coursework. Unlike BSMS students, PhD students do not have the grace period of lighter initial years, which also plays a part in lesser PhD participation.  However, one club coordinator attested that there was a lack of effort on their part to integrate PhD students in club activities. Some activities like Sea Minor (Drama club), Poetry Nights (Lit club), and Prerna (Disha) certainly see an uptick in the number of PhD volunteers and even coordinators in some cases. However, they represent just a small fraction of PhD students.


On speaking to various members of the IISER Pune community, from students and club coordinators to professors, we came across numerous suggestions for the betterment of club activities that could have wide ranging beneficial impacts on the community as a whole. These have been presented as stated by them in the following points:

1) Anonymous feedback – Collecting feedback, both, from a club’s volunteer base as well as the general student body every so often to allow for criticism to be voiced and improvement to be made on the back of it. Additional steps should also be made for constructive criticism to be invited towards the club.

2) Streamlining club events and orientation – Creating a calendar for club events and making it public would help students be better informed about the events taking place on campus that week. Displaying the calendar on the TVs in common areas across campus would additionally help club event outreach. Further, little mention is usually given to clubs and their role in campus life during the orientations held by the administration for the incoming batch. Orientations would see a substantial increase in turnout if this was done. Additionally, club orientations could be organised to occur in a short timespan of a few weeks with the schedule sent out to the student body to better streamline the process and make them easier to follow.

3) Forming a functional core team – for clubs that have the manpower to sustain it, a well-structured and motivated core team allows for the club to function like a well oiled machine, reducing the burden of running the club on two to three people

4) Good moderation and facilitation of productive discussion in club meetings by creating safe spaces for volunteers to express their opinions without fear of being judged 

5) More frequent orientations and calls for volunteers – To tackle the dip in volunteers over the course of the year by providing more opportunities for volunteers to join the club and events that the club organises

6) By communicating to both a club’s volunteer base and the general student body the shortcomings of the club, in a transparent manner – By taking responsibility for the club’s inclusivity issues and other shortcomings, ensuring responsiveness towards minority voices, and opening up avenues for dialogue between the club and its volunteers, the coordinators we spoke to think that the situation can definitely improve. 


On an ending note, we should mention that the club coordinators also felt that improving the inclusivity of clubs is a two way street. It requires an active effort from not only the clubs to be straightforward about their shortcomings and to work on them, but also the student body to partake in club activities and provide criticism, thereby improving the shared experience for the larger collective.
