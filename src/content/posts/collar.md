title: "Blue Collar Blues"
description: "The students of the institute bear an immense debt to the workers who come in to work everyday from near and far, assuring our comfort in exchange for a livelihood. The odour from the toilets that we complain about has not kept sanitation workers away from work; the spouts of muddy water from under loose bricks has not kept sweepers and cleaners at home, and unholy hours have not stopped us from getting a cup of tea and a bowl of Maggi."

"I don’t like going to school.” says Alam*, while emptying a sack of cement in front of the Hostel. “How old are you?” we ask him. The contract worker is slight, frail—doesn’t look a day older than twelve. He thinks for a while and replies, “Seventeen.” But when asked again, he mumbles, “I don’t know.” Alam is one among the hundreds of workers who earn their living in the bricks, floors, kitchens and toilets of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune.


Apart from the faculty and administration staff, IISER Pune—either directly or indirectly, through contractual leases/tenders—employs hundreds of men and women to keep the institute running around the clock. The lives of some of these workers start early in the morning. Even before the messes start dishing out food at 7:30AM, the night shift security guard gives over the plastic chair to the next on duty at 7AM, briefing them regarding any important events or details, while the janitors have the toilets clean before the early morning rush makes them dirty again. On the other hand, many of the workers have to work late into the night. V-square and Shiv Sagar close as late as midnight, while the MDP night canteen remains open all through the night closing off with the last nocturnal orders around 4:30–5AM. The security guards, too, stand witness to the night life in the Institute.


Almost all services in IISER such as housekeepers, drivers (ambulance or otherwise), civil, mechanical or technical repair persons who you meet via the ticketing interface are contracted through the company MORIA. Five years ago, all of these contracted workers were hired through the company called PRISM, which left the business but transferred all the existing workers to MORIA, resulting in a purely nominal shift with the employees remaining the same, the pay and policy unchanged.


Talking to a housekeeper in Hostel-1, who has been here for nine years, we realized that they do not have any agency to report civil, mechanical, or technical complaints via the ticketing system. It requires an IISER email ID for setting up an account and, therefore, due to the absence of floor representatives for over a year (who would have been the first point of contact), the housekeepers request the students—the handful they are familiar with—to create a ticket regarding issues that arise, which range anywhere from clogged latrine pipes to broken lights. Their shifts are from 7AM to 4PM. For Hostel-1, there are six male and three female housekeepers, one assigned to each floor—a remnant from the pre-Hostel-3 era. From another housekeeper, Ram, we come to know that some students spit paan on and around the door-side dustbins, painting even the sides of the walls, which have to be scrubbed off every time. Given how common an occurrence this is—a walk around Hostel-1 third floor would be proof enough—it’s not a stretch to infer on whom we assume the responsibility for maintaining our residential spaces falls exclusively on. Ram says that they cannot choose to behave as indifferently by not cleaning and leaving the place as it is. The housekeepers also choose not to remove the clothes left lying on the drying stands for weeks on end, even though they have been instructed to. When asked if they have anything specific to ask from the student community, Ram replies that if they cooperate, that’d be more than enough.

The Security Guards, on the other hand, are contracted via UNIVERSAL. All guards have 8-hour shifts, and at any point in time, there are 10+2 security guards. The extra two of them are called relievers, who fill up in case of absence due to emergency on the part of the rest. The place of duty and the shift (morning, evening or night) of a guard alternates weekly. After every eight days of work, the  ninth day is an official leave for them.

IISER Pune is a relatively young institute and thus has seen a lot of construction work over the last fourteen years. The sports complex and the new girls’ hostel have come up only in the last year or two. Before the prime minister’s visit here in December 2019, the institute undertook large amounts of maintenance work that included modifications to the dining block, maintaining some of the roads on campus, furnishing and beautifying the entire campus, and a large scale remodelling and reconstruction of the Guest House. Even now, there is work ongoing between the dining block and the sports complex, overseeing the construction of some pipelines for drainage. All of this causes a huge requirement for labourers.


There are over sixty such workers currently employed in IISER. These workers aren’t employed directly by IISER—the institute gives out specific contracts of projects to contractors, who employ the workers. The wages of the labourers are typically around Rs 300–350 per day. As they are daily wage workers, they are not entitled to any paid leave. On being interviewed, labourers told us that they were free to take days off at their own risk, without pay. The terms of contract of the labourers vary too. Unlike the contracts of housekeeping or teaching staff, the contracts of workers are often very short, sometimes a few months, but at times can extend to more than five years. One worker told us that he was here long enough to oversee the entire construction of the girls’ hostel.


The workers are often not local to Maharashtra and are brought by contractors from as far as Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka, among other places. After their work is done, they move out and go wherever the contract takes them. It is not unusual for the migrant workers to not know how long they’re going to work at IISER. One woman who had been here for a month said, “We have not been told how long we are going to stay here. Just as long as the work lasts. If the work is done in one month, we will leave in one, if it takes two, then two. They have not told us anything.”

The workers do not come to IISER alone. They come here with their children. One afternoon, in the slums behind girls’ hostel, we saw some twenty odd children—boys and girls, under the age of twenty—running about in the sun. But not all of them were playing.


We saw Chintu*, an eleven year old, coating the underside of a large vessel with cement, before his mother began cooking on it. “Do you go to school?” we asked him. “No.” he said—the same answer that we received from the other children. Most of them did go to school back home in their villages, but ever since their parents had taken up work here, they had not set foot in a school. It is unfortunate that despite clause 5 of Chapter III of the Right to Education Act ensuring a transfer from one school to another—anywhere in the country, irrespective of the reason why the student has shifted—none of the children are enrolled in any of the schools nearby.


The Right (of children) to (free and compulsory) Education Act of 2009, describes free education as a compulsory right of children in the age group of 6–14. Yet, children living in a premier educational institute do not go to school—some haven’t in months, others in years. Most of the children supplement their working parents by doing menial work and household chores. And the less fortunate ones, like Alam*, who was either too young or too malnourished, work as a construction labourer for a few hundred rupees a day.

The workers are housed in tin shacks in the slums behind Hostel-3 (although students have reported seeing workers, who were hired just before the prime minister’s visit, living in wooden crates near the sports complex). The shacks are typically small rooms roofed and walled with tin sheets, all in a cluster. The men and the women have separate bathing areas. The men bathe in the open, in front of a big tank of water, while the women have a roofless enclosure designated for them. In total, the workers have access to only 2 toilets—one for men and one for women. The student–toilet ratio in Hostel-1 is approximately 5:1—the worker–toilet ratio is at least 30:1, given that there are over sixty inhabitants in the slum and only 2 toilets. The conditions of the toilets are extremely unsanitary. On our visit, we saw a flush-less Indian style toilet clogged with faeces. Not just the commode, but as can be seen in the following picture, even the surrounding area was filthy with large pieces of faeces strewn.

‘Despite everything’ (the workers’ settlement in campus behind girls’ hostel)


“There were more toilets before, but they stopped working and nobody tried to fix them,” said a woman, “Nobody has been employed to clean the toilets since before the construction of the girls’ hostel was completed. Once in a while, we bring cleaners from the market.”

A second year BS-MS student says that a worker told him, “We feel disgusted using these. The children refuse to put up with these and choose to defecate in the open instead, but we have no choice, we have to use these.”

Incidentally, according to the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Pune has an ODF+ rating, a prerequisite of which states, “On any given day, not a single person defecates in the open.”

“IISER follows strict government guidelines for hiring workers,” says Dr. Deepak Barua, the current Head of the Landscape Committee, an internal body that was constituted in 2017 to oversee the landscaping on campus, “There are standardized regulations regarding the wages of the gardeners.” Dr. Anjan Banerjee, Chair of the Institutional Committee on Administration, another recently instituted committee for supervising administrative decisions of the institute, sheds more light on this, “Contractors are employed under the 1970 Contract Labour Act, wherein the employer requires the contractors to ensure minimum wage payment and paid festival holidays, among other things.” The Act also bids the principal employer (IISER) to make sure that the contractor provides appropriate living conditions vis-a-vis canteens and restrooms. However, the Contract Labour Act is not applicable to casual and intermittent labour, under which most civil work in the campus falls. “The hiring of the housekeeping, security and gardening staff is subject to these laws, but not the labourers. Nevertheless, we try to ensure that the civil contractors we employ are reliable, and we are willing to terminate the contracts at the slightest transgression. In fact,” Dr. Banerjee adds, “we have done so in the past, when a gardening supervisor was suspected of underpayment.”


“Gardeners working overtime during the Prime Minister’s visit were duly compensated,” says Dr. Barua, “we did not hire any supplementary staff.” The same, however, was clearly untrue for the civil labourers. The months of November–December 2019 saw a huge influx of construction workers whose mismanagement resulted in the workers reportedly sleeping in crates around campus. “I was not aware of this,” claims Dr. Banerjee. He conjectures, “A possible explanation could be labourers who weren’t supposed to be living on campus worked overtime and decided to sleep there instead of leaving and returning the next day. Or it could be the contractors hiring some extra help and not managing it properly.” He wishes that the incident had been reported to him earlier.


But what about the issue of open defecation? “I am very surprised to hear about this,” exclaims Dr. Banerjee, “We need to look into it soon. This is unacceptable and a health hazard.” But does the institute claim responsibility? “It’s difficult to say, because it is the contractors’ job to ensure amenities, but as it is happening on institute grounds, IISER bears the responsibility of remedying it once we have been made aware of it.” Open defecation, in fact, is not a secret. Multiple students and a professor have noticed it, although no one reported it. Does this mean that a campus resident’s right to hygienic living conditions should be at the mercy of the vigilance of others? Does the institute believe that a systemic change is in order? “Yes, it would be a good idea to have a forum for workers to lodge complaints directly, that is something to be discussed,” says Dr. Banerjee.

Given how the Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected daily wage earners, we reached out to the Registrar, Col. G. Raja Shekhar, to find out how the labourers have been dealing with the crisis. Of the seventy odd population of migrant workers, five have been reported to leave IISER before the lockdown. As most of the labourers in IISER remained in Pune owing to the travel restrictions, they were provided with basic necessities of ration and money with the help of their contractor. Hostels were closed, and housekeepers were off-duty. The labourers soon resumed work internally with the ongoing (at the time of the report) installation of a transformer and Guest House renovation. There was an endowment fund collection to cover further living expenses of the labourers. During the lockdown, workers were only given holidays, and there were no layoffs or reduction in the gardening, housekeeping or the security staff.


We also spoke to the registrar about our concerns regarding the sanitation facilities of the workers—a problem especially relevant during the pandemic. We were asked to write to him formally, and soon after the relevant employees were directed to ensure the cleaning of the toilets. We further requested the registrar to have more toilets built, which we have yet to receive an update on.


With the nationwide migrant crisis and the impending relaxation of labour laws, it isn’t difficult to see how calamities and their consequences scale unfairly for the labour class—and how the shackles of poverty and prejudice keep countless such Alams from school. Therefore, while we commend the institute’s commitment in ensuring a campus environment that is fair and considerate to its residents, we certainly believe there is space for dialogue and action, and that the onus of change lies on all of us. Vigilance and voice are the surest weapons at our disposal to build a campus community that looks out for one another.
