*This article intends to update the reader (a student probably) on the issues that the Constitution of the Student Council of IISER Pune faces. Even apart from the problems in its phrasing and structure, trouble arises from its selective interpretation and, at times, the complete disregard with which the administration and previous Councils have treated it.* 

As a student population, there are numerous ways that the policies of the administration and its various committees affect our daily lives, and the Student Council is meant to provide us with our only access to these deliberations and have any say in their decisions. Of course, one cannot expect that an institution will spend all of its time trying to satisfy the desires of every student, but to what extent does the Council achieve its role?

Currently, the full extent of the influence of student representatives is a maximum of one-third of the votes on any committee. This implies that they can be ignored entirely. 
Warning: This realization has nothing to do with the claim that the administration is a villain out to harm us every chance they get. But we hope that you, dear reader, understand that the purpose of the Constitution should have been to guarantee the students some level of control in the decision-making that affects us.

“In all its function, the Student Council has the following core aims that shall guide all its actions, and are therefore held inviolable:
… 
To act as a body for accountability in matters of administration of various aspects of student life.” 
– Preamble of the Constitution of the Student Council, IISER Pune

Depending on the number of candidates standing in the election, the election committee decides how many representatives a particular year’s Council will have. After the elections, the elected representatives meet in the First Council Meeting and nominate themselves to committees they’d like to serve on. The General Secretary collects these nominations and conducts an internal vote to decide who is assigned to which committee. 

Students vote the candidates into the Council rather than into any specific Committees. Hence, they have no choice which member is in which committee. This makes the boundaries between the responsibilities of different Committee Representatives (CRs) hazy. 

We also do not have access to the meeting minutes of the previous Council (2023) and hence don’t know who did what. This was apparent in last year's Hostel Evacuation issue, where certain Council members were more involved than the Hostel CR himself. This makes it so much harder to hold someone accountable. The Council's decision-making as a whole dilutes the accountability of the individual.

Furthermore, a Council that didn’t campaign for the elections as a group should not be held accountable as a group; they will, of course, have their differences. This gets even more complicated when there are differing standpoints within the Council—added to the fact that the structure of the Constitution puts a lot of weight on the unanimity of the decisions of the Council. 

Because of the difficulty in assigning or assuming responsibility, even a motivated Council member may be unable to engage with the specific issues they care about. 

A possible solution:
We could have direct elections for particular committees, where candidates campaign for the specific problems they aim to address by being on that committee. This would allow these elected representatives to be held accountable for their activities, and they would be responsible for keeping the students updated about the status of petitions and committee-specific student concerns. In this scenario, the Council is a formal way for the General Secretary to recognize petitions, hold hearings, etc., such as in the case of a petition to remove a CR.

– This might be too harsh a dilution of the responsibility of the Council as a whole, and we don’t pretend to be the best suited to come up with the best model of accountability. But only by thinking about these issues together will we be able to improve.


#### The Issue with Amendments

For an Amendment to the Constitution to be passed, the Council needs to have unanimity, i.e., every member of the Council must be on board for it to be passed. This hands every Council member a veto, which isn't a good idea, given that practically anyone who stands gets elected. Amendments to the student Constitution have been proposed in the past, but none have been passed as of the writing of this article. This misstep of the original Constitution led to a Catch-22 situation in 2021, where a provision to codify amendments was left hanging, in need of itself to pass through to implementation, due to a single non-complying PhD representative in a Council of 17 members. A simple fix would be changing this to a 2/3rd or a 3/4th majority, as suggested by the GSec of the 2020-21 Council in an email to the director, attached below.

This extra-constitutional attempt failed


One uncooperative member can ‘hang’ the council and prevent it from carrying out its activities. There is no provision for the council to exclude such members from decisions despite complete agreement from the other members to do so. The Constitution must implement a method to formally impeach problematic members and amend the condition of unanimity to a more realistic approach of a 2/3rds or simple majority system for other internal decision-making. We are likely to see an amendment to this effect. A previous Council faced such an issue and proposed amendments along the lines of a Code of Conduct to formally characterize and take action against members they deem ‘Uncooperative.’

Say the Council is like a machine with a computer inside. The powers vested by the administration in the Council through the Constitution are like the lasers and arms sticking out of the machine. These need to be reasonable and subject to control by the administration.
Meanwhile, the computer should be free of control and reflect what the student body desires. And so, amendments concerned with the Council's internal functioning should be free of any college administrative body.

According to the General Secretary (23-24) during last year’s Republic Day speech (26th January 2024), we would have expected to see a mail in a few weeks saying, “The Constitution of IISER Pune has been amended for the first time in its history.” On the 2nd September 2024, the Student Council (2023) announced via a newsletter that some amendments were in the works; this implies that there has been perfect unanimity in the Council. However, they have not been published, and no public information was available about these changes —until the Student Council (24-25) published minutes of their meetings with the Dean SA. 

According to the Dean, the Board of Governors (BoG) and the Director are required to make the changes official, despite the Constitution never identifying these bodies in its section on Amendments. This is accepted as a matter of fact by the Dean SA, and the previous and current Student Councils. 

With the elections of 2024 now behind us, these amendments should have been implemented many months ago. The current Council was appointed under the now five-year-old unchanged Constitution and has already served one semester under it, despite the amendments being passed ages ago. On inquiring about these amendments to the Student Council (24-25) during their first townhall, the General Secretary replied that the amended Constitution has been lying on the desk of the Director, waiting to be signed, and according to the minutes will only be codified by the registrar after the next BoG meeting.


#### The Issue with Elections

Before the Council Elections 2023, students organized and collected over 500 signatures supporting a redraft and the cancellation of elections. They were entirely ignored by the administration, which conducted the elections anyway, appointing all the candidates who stood in the elections with less than 300 people voting. A council shouldn’t be granted any legitimacy if more people voted against it than for it, and it is clear that the election committee 2023 had no concern for this basic logical conclusion or care to represent the student’s interests.

In the Council elections of 2024, there was a further shrinkage of voter turnout, and there was no organized effort by the student body to cancel the elections. Anirban Hazra, a faculty member on the election committee, brought up the prospect of conducting elections in the January semester instead of the August semester, a change that would allow the most active members of student activities on campus, i.e., the first years, to vote and stand in the elections (if the Constitution allowed it). 

This also feeds into the discussion regarding a need for more structure to give legitimacy to referendum-type and public voting initiatives. There have been many examples of large spontaneous organization amongst students, especially when we have felt that the council is doing far from an adequate job of representing us. A motion of no confidence is a petition against a member or the whole council with the support of at least 1/3rd of BSMS and PhD students. Such a petition would allow us to remove the Council, but no action will be taken until there is a way to acknowledge and record these opinions.
